### Hi there 👋

My name is Fernando Ellerbrock Theodoro, and I am a sophomore student at the Industrial Technological High School "Prof. Isaac Portal Roldán" - State University of São Paulo. 
Aspiring computer engineer and fullstack developer. I love math and most things related to technology - if something interests me, I will learn it.

Currently studying complex analysis
